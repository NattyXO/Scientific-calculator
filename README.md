# Scientific Calculator
A scientific calculator program capable of performing basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, unit conversions, and hexadecimal conversions, with error handling for invalid inputs and overflow exceptions.

## Features

- **Standard and Scientific Modes:** Switch between standard and scientific calculator modes.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Trigonometric Functions:** Sine, cosine, tangent, hyperbolic sine, cosine, tangent.
- **Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:** Exponential, logarithm base 10, and natural logarithm.
- **Unit Conversion:** Conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit, miles and kilometers, centimeters and meters.
- **Binary Conversion:** Decimal to binary conversion.
- **Memory Functionality:** Basic memory operations (clear, recall, save).

## Installation

Go to the [Release] (https://github.com/NattyXO/Scientific-calculator/releases) section, where you can find the executable file, and run the application.

## Usage

- **Standard Mode:** Use for basic arithmetic operations.
- **Scientific Mode:** Access scientific functions and unit conversion options.

## Optimizations

It takes me hours of coding to handle invalid inputs and overflow exceptions.
You can optimise by when the user input math expression like this 3*5-2(6+8)%6/3*e-3*π+√34
This expression convert to Standard math equation like this (3 * 5) - ((((2 * (6 + 8)) % 6) / 3) * e) - (3 * π) + √(34) = 7.7817981628
e = Euler
